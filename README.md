# cmake external lib example

This is a working example project to demonstrate how to use an external library (libfoo) within a cmake project.

- FindFoo.cmake provides access to the external lib. It is based on Daniel Pfeifers talk [Effective CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXLMQ6WgIk) ([slide 22](https://github.com/boostcon/cppnow_presentations_2017/blob/master/05-19-2017_friday/effective_cmake__daniel_pfeifer__cppnow_05-19-2017.pdf)).
